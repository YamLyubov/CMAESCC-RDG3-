Code was originally created for competition - CMAESCC-RDG3  for Call for Competition on Evolutionary Computation in the Energy Domain: Smart Grid Applications 2021 http://www.gecad.isep.ipp.pt/ERM-competitions/2021-2/ 
Results were bublished in the article Optimizing DSO Requests Management Flexibility for Home Appliances Using CBCC-RDG3

This article covers a case study with homes equipped with multiple appliances for energy consumption. 
The central goal is to provide for aggregatorsâ€™ flexibility in distribution networks by building an optimal 
schedule that takes advantage of load flexibility resources. This, in turn, allows for the re-scheduling of 
shifting/real-time home appliances to provision a request from a distribution system operator (DSO).
